      <h1>Welcome to Contact, the new Rails based Newsletter &amp; Mailing program</h1>

      <p>
        Contact is a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> 
        app designed to serve email newsletters and mailing lists.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is actually a proper version of a mailer I 
        made on Rails 1.2.x which needs a rewrite and update.
        Thought I would do it properly and let anyone else who
        is interested in on the fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contact's purpose is to allow you to send out emails to
        a mailing list without having to use the commercial email
        companies.  Much like PHPList's purpose, it has the advantages
        of being on Rails and Ruby, making it extensible, and easy.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have suggestions, feel free to <a href="mailto:&#x72;&#x61;&#x61;&#x73;&#x64;&#x6E;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;">email me</a>, or visit the
        mailer <a href="http://contact.github.com">github site</a>, 
        and fork and code or just submit patches.
      </p>
