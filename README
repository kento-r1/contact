== Welcome to Contact

Contact is a Ruby on Rails app designed to server newsletters and
mass mailouts.

This is actually a proper version of a mailer I made on Rails 1.2.x
which needs a rewrite and update.  Thought I would do it properly
and let anyone else who is interested in on the fun.

Contact's purpose is to allow you to send out emails to
a mailing list without having to use the commercial email
companies.  Much like PHPList's purpose, it has the advantages
of being on Rails and Ruby, making it extensible, and easy.

If you have suggestions, feel free to email me at raasdnil@gmail.com,
or visit the contact github site: http://contact.github.com, 
and fork and code or just submit patches.

Mikel
